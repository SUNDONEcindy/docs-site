### Zowe installation and packaging

### Zowe Application Framework

### Zowe API Mediation Layer

### Zowe CLI

#### Zowe CLI (Core)

- The `zowe zos-files copy data-set` command now copies members from a source partitioned data set to an existing target partitioned data set. ([#2386](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2386))
- Download members matching a specified pattern with the new command `zowe zos-files download all-members-matching` (`zowe files dl amm`). ([#2359](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2359))
- Pass a `.zosattributes` file path for the download encoding format by adding the new `--attributes` flag to the `zowe zos-files upload` command. ([#2322](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2322))
- Add the new `--ignore-not-found` flag to avoid file-not-found error messages when deleting files so scripts are not interrupted during automated batch processing. The flag bypasses warning prompts to confirm delete actions. ([#2254](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2254))
- Added the `--wait-for-active` and `--wait-for-output` flags to download options for the `zos-jobs` command group. ([#2328](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2328))
- Added support for running applications on TSO/E address spaces. Start applications and receive/transmit messages using the new `tso start`, `tso receive`, and `tso send` commands. ([#2280](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2280))
- Added optional `--attributes` flag to the `zowe zos-files upload file-to-uss` command to allow passing a `.zosattributes` file path for upload encoding format. ([#2319](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2319))
- Issue the `zowe files search data-sets` command with the new `--encoding` option to use a different code page when searching data set contents. ([#2161](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2161))
- Add the new `--stateful` flag to `zos-tso issue cmd` to allow declaring the statefulness of the address space being created. ([#2240](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2240))
- To minimize the amount of unnecessary text returned from TSO commands, the `--suppress-startup-messages` flag default value changed to `true`. ([#2240](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2240))

#### Zowe CLI Imperative Framework

- Added the `DeferredPromise` class to Imperative to provide utilities for data synchronization. ([#2405](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2405))
