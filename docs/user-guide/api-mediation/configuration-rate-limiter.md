# Configuring custom rate limiter


The API Gateway offers a way to customize the rate limit per service by introducing a configurable rate limiter.

## Procedure

1. In the zowe.yaml, set the following rate limiting properties in api/gateway/routing:

   * **rateLimiterCapacity**  
  Defines the total number of requests that can be allowed at one time per user.

   * **rateLimiterTokens**  
  Defines the number of requests that are added to the serviceâ€™s allowance at regular intervals. This property controls how quickly requests are replenished after being consumed.

   * **rateLimiterRefillDuration**  
  Sets the time interval (in minutes) at which new requests (or tokens) are added.

2. Define the services to limit:

   Use `servicesToLimitRequestRate` to specify a list of services to limit. In the following example, this property applies to the API Catalog. 

**Example configuration:**
```
    apiml:
        gateway: 
            routing: 
                rateLimiterCapacity: 20
                rateLimiterTokens: 20
                rateLimiterRefillDuration: 1
                servicesToLimitRequestRate: apicatalog
```
